[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mohae/utilitybelt?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mohae/utilitybelt)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mohae/utilitybelt.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mohae/utilitybelt)

Some functions in Go; though their functionality is questionable.

### Status
* Limited functionality
* Under development.

## About
Even though my utility belt isn't as cool as Batman's, its useful for doing a variety of simple things in Go. This is mainly a repository for commonly used code that I don't know where else to put it.

The utility belt will become more useful or less.

Often, I will find that there already is something in stdlib, I just hadn't found it before.

## Usage
Just don't unless you have to. If I use anything in here its just as a stop-gap.
