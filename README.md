utilitybelt
===========

Some functions in Go; though their functionality is questionable.

### Status
* Limited functionality
* Under development.
* For toy use only, meant to try things.

## About
Even though my utility belt isn't as cool as Batman's, its useful for doing a variety of simple things in Go. This is mainly a repository for commonly used code that I don't know whereelse to put it.

The utility belt will become more useful or less.

Often, I will find that there already is something in stdlib, I just hadn't found it before.

## Usage
Just don't unless you have to. If I use anything in here its just as a stop-gap.
